**üöÄ Version 2.0.0 - Major Update!** Smart Context has evolved from a file selector to a comprehensive **AI Context Engineer** that generates complete context packages for LLMs. Transform vague queries into structured, actionable context with code, relationships, and insights.

## üéØ What's New in v2.0.0

### From File Selector to AI Context Engineer
Smart Context now acts as your personal AI Context Engineer, solving a critical problem: **users often don't provide enough context for AI tools to work effectively**. Instead of just suggesting files, it now:

- **Extracts actual code** from functions and relevant sections
- **Maps relationships** between files through imports/exports
- **Recognizes error patterns** and suggests fixes
- **Generates structured packages** optimized for AI consumption
- **Works alongside grep** to enhance, not replace, traditional search

### New Tool: `generate_context_package`
The flagship feature that transforms any query into a complete context package:
```javascript
// Before v2.0.0: Just file paths
["src/cart.js", "src/checkout.js"]

// After v2.0.0: Complete context with code
{
  "context": {
    "coreImplementation": {
      "code": "const getTotalPrice = () => { ... }",
      "function": "getTotalPrice",
      "lines": "48-56"
    }
  },
  "relationships": {
    "dependencies": [...],
    "provides": [...]
  },
  "suggestedFix": {
    "pattern": "NaN in calculation",
    "suggestion": "Check if item.price is undefined"
  }
}
```

## Usage

### For Claude Code CLI (Project-Specific)

Install in your project:
```bash
cd your-project
npm install @crisnc100/smart-context-mcp
```

Create `.mcp.json` in project root:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smart-context": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./node_modules/@crisnc100/smart-context-mcp/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_ROOT": "."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

See [CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md](./CLAUDE_CODE_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### For Claude Desktop (Global)

**IMPORTANT**: Smart Context needs to know WHERE your project files are located. You must set `PROJECT_ROOT` for each project.

#### For NPM Installation:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smart-context": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@crisnc100/smart-context-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_ROOT": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Local Installation:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "smart-context": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/smart_context_mcp/src/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_ROOT": "/path/to/your/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### For Codex CLI (OpenAI)

**IMPORTANT**: Codex CLI uses `mcp_servers` (underscore) rather than `mcpServers` (camelCase).

#### For NPM Installation (TOML format):
```toml
[mcp_servers.smart-context]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "@crisnc100/smart-context-mcp"]
env = { "PROJECT_ROOT" = "/path/to/your/project" }
```

#### For Local Installation (TOML format):
```toml
[mcp_servers.smart-context]
command = "node"
args = ["/path/to/smart_context_mcp/src/index.js"]
env = { "PROJECT_ROOT" = "/path/to/your/project" }
```

**First Time Setup?** Run the setup wizard tool in Claude:
```
Use the setup_wizard tool to check my Smart Context configuration
```

  }
}
```

### üîç `get_optimal_context` - **File Selection Tool**

Use generate_context_package with query="getTotalPrice returns NaN in cart"
Use generate_context_package to understand "how does the authentication system work"
Use generate_context_package for "add email notification when order ships"

// Get relevant files with grep commands
Use get_optimal_context to find files related to "fixing the user authentication flow"

// Search for specific concepts
Use search_codebase to find files containing "websocket connection handling"

// Configure for large projects
Use set_project_scope to only include src/** and exclude test files
```

## How It Works

### Version 2.0.0 - AI Context Engineer
Smart Context has evolved from a file selector to a comprehensive **AI Context Engineer** that:

1. **Understands Your Query**: Uses NLP to extract intent, concepts, entities, and error patterns
2. **Extracts Real Code**: Finds and extracts actual functions and code sections, not just file paths
3. **Maps Relationships**: Analyzes imports, exports, and dependencies between files
4. **Suggests Fixes**: Recognizes common error patterns (NaN, null, undefined) and suggests solutions
5. **Enforces Token Budgets**: Intelligently allocates tokens across different context sections
6. **Learns From Usage**: Tracks which files and code sections actually helped solve problems

### Core Process
1. **Query Analysis**: Deep semantic understanding of your task
2. **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Files scored on semantic similarity, git history, imports, and learned patterns
3. **Code Extraction**: Pulls specific functions and relevant code sections
4. **Relationship Mapping**: Builds dependency graph of your codebase
5. **Context Generation**: Creates structured package optimized for AI consumption

## Task Modes

- **Debug Mode**: Prioritizes recently changed files, error handlers, and test files
- **Feature Mode**: Focuses on interfaces, similar features, and type definitions  
- **Refactor Mode**: Includes all usages, dependencies, and related tests

## Configuration

The server can be configured through:

1. **Configuration file** (`config/default.json`)
2. **Local overrides** (`config/local.json`)
3. **Environment variables**

### Configuration Options

```json
{
  "context": {
    "defaultTokenBudget": 6000,
    "minRelevanceScore": 0.3,
    "progressiveLevels": {
      "immediate": 0.6,
      "expanded": 0.4,
      "comprehensive": 0.2
    }
  },
  "fileScanning": {
    "maxFileSize": 1048576,  // 1MB in bytes
    "ignorePatterns": ["node_modules/**", "*.log"]
  },
  "git": {
    "recentChangesHours": 48,
    "defaultCommitLimit": 100
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables

- `SMART_CONTEXT_TOKEN_BUDGET` - Override default token budget
- `SMART_CONTEXT_MIN_RELEVANCE` - Minimum relevance score threshold
- `SMART_CONTEXT_MAX_FILE_SIZE` - Maximum file size to scan (in bytes)
- `SMART_CONTEXT_GIT_COMMIT_LIMIT` - Number of commits to analyze

## Performance Optimization

For large projects:

1. **Use Project Scopes**: Configure include/exclude patterns with `set_project_scope`
2. **Adjust Token Budget**: Lower `targetTokens` for faster responses
3. **Set Relevance Threshold**: Increase `minRelevanceScore` to be more selective
4. **Progressive Loading**: Start with `progressiveLevel: 1` for immediate context

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# All tests
npm run test:all

# Individual test suites
npm run test:scanner      # File scanning tests
npm run test:performance  # Performance benchmarks
npm run test:error        # Error handling tests
npm test                  # Full validation suite
```

### Available Test Files

- `test-final-validation.js` - Main validation suite
- `test-scanner.js` - File scanning functionality
- `test-performance.js` - Performance benchmarks
- `test-error-handling.js` - Error handling tests
- `test-cross-platform.js` - Cross-platform compatibility
- `test-mcp-server.js` - MCP server functionality
- `run-all-tests.js` - Test runner for all suites
- Various scenario tests for query styles, edge cases, and real-world usage

## üìä Performance

Performance characteristics:
- **Scanning**: ~85 files/second
- **Response**: <200ms (warm cache)
- **Memory**: ~30KB per file
- **Accuracy**: 85%+ relevance

## üîç How It Works

The Smart Context MCP Server uses a multi-factor scoring system:

1. **Semantic Analysis**: NLP understanding of your task
2. **Import Graph**: Traces code dependencies
3. **Git History**: Analyzes co-change patterns
4. **Learning System**: Improves from your feedback
5. **Task Modes**: Adapts strategy for debug/feature/refactor

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No files found"**
- Run `setup_wizard` with `action="check"` to verify configuration
- Ensure `PROJECT_ROOT` points to your actual project directory
- Check that the directory contains code files (.js, .ts, .py, etc.)

**"Server doesn't appear in Claude"**
- Fully restart Claude Desktop (not just reload)
- Check JSON syntax in your config file
- Verify the command path exists

**Performance issues**
- Use `set_project_scope` to limit scanning area
- Reduce token budget or increase relevance threshold
