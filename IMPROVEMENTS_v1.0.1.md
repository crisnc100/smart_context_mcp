# Smart Context MCP v1.0.1 Improvements

## Summary

Based on user feedback that the tool failed to find `exerciseFormatters.ts` when searching for "exercise naming formatting variation names", we've implemented significant improvements to the semantic search and query understanding capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Query Enhancement System** (NEW)
- Added `QueryEnhancer` class that understands implicit code patterns
- Automatically expands queries with relevant function and file hints
- Example: "naming" → adds hints like "construct", "format", "build", "create"

### 2. **Improved Semantic Search**
- **Function-first matching**: Prioritizes function name matches (0.4 weight)
- **File pattern matching**: Boosts files with relevant patterns (formatter, utils, etc.)
- **Better tokenization**: Includes camelCase variations and code-specific terms

### 3. **Lower Relevance Thresholds**
- Reduced `minRelevanceScore` from 0.3 to 0.15
- More files are considered, reducing false negatives
- Progressive disclosure still limits initial results

### 4. **Fallback Mechanism**
- Never returns empty results when files exist
- Shows top 5 matches even if below threshold
- Clear indication when showing low-relevance results

### 5. **Enhanced Function Extraction**
- Multiple regex patterns to catch different function styles:
  - Regular functions: `function myFunc() {}`
  - Arrow functions: `const myFunc = () => {}`
  - Method shorthand: `myFunc() {}`
  - TypeScript methods: `public myFunc(): void`
  - Export variations

## Test Results

Using our comprehensive test suite with 10 different query patterns:

```
✅ Original case: "exercise naming formatting variation names"
   - Now correctly finds exerciseFormatters.ts at 100% relevance
   - Also finds related files like exerciseService.ts

✅ Other difficult cases tested:
   - "user authentication token validation" → finds authMiddleware.js (85%)
   - "database connection pool error handling" → finds dbConnection.js (60%)
   - "transform normalize data pipeline" → finds dataTransformer.js (100%)
   - "react hook fetch loading state" → finds useFetch.js (45%)
```

## Technical Details

### Query Enhancement Example
```javascript
Input: "exercise naming formatting variation names"
Enhanced:
  - Function hints: formatName, getName, constructName, buildName, 
                   formatExercise, exerciseFormatter, formatVariation...
  - File hints: naming, formatting
  - Patterns: construct, format, build, create, formatter, utils
```

### Semantic Similarity Calculation
1. Function name matching (highest priority - 0.4 per match)
2. File path patterns (0.3 per match)
3. Concept matching (0.15 per match)
4. Token matching (0.1 per match)

## Migration Notes

No configuration changes required. The improvements are backward compatible and will automatically enhance existing installations.

## Next Steps

1. Continue monitoring user feedback
2. Consider adding machine learning for query intent detection
3. Build a feedback loop to learn from successful/failed searches
