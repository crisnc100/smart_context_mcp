# Release Notes - v2.0.0

## ðŸŽ¯ Major Pivot: From Grep Helper to AI Context Engineer

Smart Context MCP has evolved from being a "grep assistant" to become a comprehensive **AI Context Engineer** that generates complete context packages to help AI tools understand and solve coding problems better.

## Why the Pivot?

After testing showed only 20-30% improvement in grep efficiency, we realized the real problem: **users give vague prompts without enough context, causing AI to make mistakes or work harder than necessary**.

## What's New?

### ðŸš€ Context Package Generation
The new `generate_context_package` tool creates structured context packages that include:

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "query": "getTotalPrice returns NaN",
    "taskMode": "debugging",
    "confidence": 0.8
  },
  "problem": {
    "description": "Calculation error in cart total",
    "likelyLocation": "CartContext.js:50",
    "errorType": "NaN"
  },
  "context": {
    "coreImplementation": "...",
    "usage": "...",
    "dataFlow": "..."
  },
  "checklist": [
    "Check for division by zero",
    "Verify data types",
    "Check for null values"
  ],
  "suggestedFix": {
    "pattern": "Result is NaN",
    "example": "const value = parseFloat(input) || 0;"
  }
}
```

### âœ¨ Key Features

1. **Task Mode Detection**: Automatically identifies if you're debugging, adding features, refactoring, or reviewing
2. **Error Pattern Recognition**: Recognizes common errors (NaN, null, undefined) and suggests fixes
3. **Smart Checklists**: Generates task-specific checklists to guide problem-solving
4. **Token Budget Management**: Respects LLM context limits while maximizing useful information
5. **Semantic Understanding**: Goes beyond keywords to understand intent and concepts

### ðŸ”§ Still Helps Grep!

The original grep assistance features are still there and better than ever:
- `smart_grep` tool for intelligent pattern generation
- Grep commands included in all context results
- Better pattern extraction for code identifiers

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Old way: Vague prompt
"fix the cart"

// With Smart Context: Complete package
{
  "problem": "Cart total calculation error",
  "location": "CartContext.js:getTotalPrice",
  "checklist": ["Check null values", "Verify types"],
  "suggestedFix": "Add parseFloat() guards",
  "relevantFiles": ["CartContext.js", "Cart.js"],
  "grepCommands": ["grep -n 'getTotalPrice' src/"]
}
```

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @crisnc100/smart-context-mcp
```

## Breaking Changes

- Minimum Node version: 16.0.0
- New tool: `generate_context_package` 
- Enhanced response formats in existing tools

## What's Next?

- Implement conversation memory for progressive context building
- Add `enhance_query` tool for vague prompt improvement
- Create more sophisticated stub method implementations
- Add team learning aggregation

## Feedback

This is a major pivot based on user feedback. The goal is to make AI coding assistants more effective by providing them with the right context in the right shape. Please share your experience!
